I’ve had seasonal allergies since childhood, especially triggered by pollen.
My doctor prescribed Cetirizine which I take every evening during allergy season.
I also carry an epipen because I once had a severe reaction to peanuts.
Next Monday I have a check-up scheduled to review my allergy test results.
I need to remember to stay off antihistamines two days before the test.
Sometimes I also experience mild asthma symptoms at night.
Actually, correction: doctor said I must stop antihistamines three days before the test, not two.
If the allergy panel confirms strong peanut sensitivity, I may need to get immunotherapy injections this year.
I’ve recently started keeping an air purifier in my bedroom to help with breathing.
My doctor recommended I increase my vitamin D intake as well.
I feel stressed about the test results because the symptoms got worse this year.
Next month I need to follow up with the pulmonologist about the night wheezing.
I also plan to start mild morning jogging once the air quality improves.
Oh, and I should remember to carry the epipen when traveling outdoors.
Actually correction: I no longer take Cetirizine every evening, switched to Levocetirizine last week.
If the immunotherapy works, doctor said I might need shots every few months.
In case of any severe reaction, I’ve been told to visit the emergency ward immediately.
I’m hopeful that avoiding peanuts and staying consistent with medication will help.
My next vitamin level check is in 6 months.

I booked this online consultation because I’ve been having chest tightness for the past five days.
The discomfort gets worse when I’m stressed or after climbing stairs.
I don’t have any known heart conditions but my dad has high blood pressure.
Yesterday I checked my BP at home and it showed 148/92 which scared me.
I also feel dizzy at times, especially when standing up suddenly.
My office workload has been insane lately and I hardly sleep 5 hours a night.
I’ve been drinking a lot of coffee to stay awake these days.
The clinic asked me to get an ECG done tomorrow morning before the consultation call.
They also suggested a fasting lipid profile and a basic blood panel.
Actually correction: the ECG is scheduled for tomorrow evening, not morning.
If my cholesterol turns out high, I want to fix it with diet and exercise instead of medicines.
I’m a bit anxious because sometimes I feel a short stabbing pain near my left shoulder.
I’m not allergic to any medication as far as I know.
For the past month I’ve also had mild headaches every few days.
I want to start daily morning walks if the doctor recommends it.
I’ve cut down salt intake since yesterday after reading about hypertension.
In two weeks I’m supposed to follow up with the cardiologist for a detailed review.
I’m also planning to start magnesium supplements if the doctor suggests it.
If the reports say everything is fine, I want to continue a healthier lifestyle regardless.
Actually correction: I think the dizziness might be due to dehydration, so I’m increasing water intake now.

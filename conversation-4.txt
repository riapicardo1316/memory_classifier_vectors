I’ve been having constant headaches for the past two weeks, so I booked a doctor appointment for Monday morning.
It’s with a neurologist at CityCare Hospital near my workplace.
My doctor said I might have a vitamin deficiency, so he asked me to do a full blood test.
Actually, correction: the appointment got moved to Tuesday morning instead of Monday.
I also need to remember to fast the night before the blood test.
The doctor wants to check my migraines because they’ve been getting worse lately.
Next month I’m supposed to return for a follow-up review after the test results.
I’m a little anxious about the scan he recommended, but I hope it’s nothing serious.
If the vitamin deficiency is confirmed, I’ll need to start supplements every day.
Also, I’ve decided that after this checkup I will start going on morning walks for my health.

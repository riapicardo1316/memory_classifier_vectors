Hi doctor, my name is Jonathan Reed and I live in Chicago.
I’ve been experiencing frequent chest tightness for the last 3 weeks.
I booked a cardiology appointment for next Monday morning.
The doctor last time suspected low potassium so he prescribed supplements for 14 days.
I need to take one tablet every morning with breakfast.
Actually, correction: the appointment got rescheduled to Tuesday morning instead.
I feel really scared about these symptoms because they’ve been getting worse.
Today I also need to remember to fast for 12 hours before the tests.
Next month I have to return for a follow-up cardiac evaluation.
I still live in Chicago, but my name is actually Jonathan Carter, not Jonathan Reed.
I’ve started taking magnesium capsules daily since the last consultation.
But now that I think about it, my appointment might actually be Wednesday morning, not Tuesday.
I also get mild migraines occasionally and I’m worried they are connected.
I want to stop smoking completely this year because the doctor recommended it.
My doctor told me yesterday to reduce salt intake as well.
I was terrified two weeks ago, but I feel more calm now after talking with you.
Actually correction: my chest tightness has reduced a bit recently.
Next week I also need to schedule a blood pressure review.
I’m still taking magnesium but I stopped the potassium completely.
Oh, and I really enjoy basketball and pizza on weekends just to relax my mind.
